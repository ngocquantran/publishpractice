      <h3>Session 2</h3>
      <h4>That's too expensive!</h4>
      <p>
        Welcome to the first of our special activites which help you learn
        practical English for real situations. In life, whether you love it or
        hate it, sometimes you need to haggle - you need to try to get a better
        price for something. Some people are natural hagglers, and even if you
        are, you can still learn some useful English expressions to help you get
        the best deal. In the UK, haggling is not as common as in some other
        countries. You wouldn't normally haggle in a department store here, or
        in other big shops. But you might haggle in a market, or for something
        like a second-hand car...
      </p>
      <h4>To do</h4>
      <p>
        Listen to the audio. Rob is trying to buy a car from Neil, while Finn
        explains some of the language they use. How much does Rob eventually pay
        for the car? While you listen for the answer, make a note of the
        haggling phrases and expressions that Finn talks about. You'll also find
        some definitions of key words in the vocabulary area.

      <h4>Key language</h4>
      <p>
        So, Rob paid £600 in the end. And here are the 'haggling expressions'
        that Finn talked about:
      </p>
      <h4>1. 'Do'= sell</h4>
      <p>
        When we are haggling, instead of using the verb <b>sell</b> , we often
        use <b>do</b>. We use it with <b>can/can't</b> and
        <b>could/couldn't</b> :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>I <b>can</b> probably <b>do it for</b> about £650.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><b>Can't</b> you <b>do it a bit cheaper</b> ?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><b>Could</b> you <b>do it for</b> 500?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>You <b>couldn't do it for</b> £550?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>2. To 'knock off'</h4>
      <p>This phrasal verb means 'lower the price'.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Can you <b>knock off</b> another £30?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>I could <b>knock off</b> £10 for you.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Next</h4>
      <p>
        Now – can you use these expressions to haggle? Let's find out in the
        next activity, as you try to buy a camera at a bargain price.
