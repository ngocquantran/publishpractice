      <h3>Session 1</h3>
      <h4>Hyphenation</h4>
      <p>
        My <b>sixty-year-old mother-in-law</b> did a <b>ten-foot dive</b> into
        the <b>swimming pool</b> and was <b>greatly admired</b> . Why do we
        write some of those phrases with hyphens but not others? It's all to do
        with using numbers, adverbs and where these phrases appear in the
        sentence. Listen to 6 Minute Vocabulary with
        <b>hard-working</b> presenters Neil and Catherine to find out more. Then
        have a go at our practice activities.

        That's it for another language-improving session! We hope you have
        learnt a lot about how hyphens work in some English phrases. <br />
        In the next session we're going to learn how to get the best price for
        something - in other words how to haggle. Can Rob get a good price for a
        car? Join us to find out.
